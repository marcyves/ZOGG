ZOGG Online Group Grading  

## Presentation
The purpose of this tool is to help a professor to grade groups of students working in teams. Different activities, different group members and at the end you need to give one grade per student.

If you are tired of struggling with Excel spreadsheets and copying grades from members to members for each of your tutorials, this tool is for you!

You can manage different classes of students from different courses in different programs from different schools.

I am using it for several years and implement new features as soon as I require them.

Share your concerns and we will share our solutions !
